What Are Pina Bausch and Her Dancers Doing in Wuppertal?,1983,99,"Wuppertal is a drizzly, industrial city on the Rhine and one immediately wonders why Pina Bausch and her avant-garde dance troupe have settled there. A socially engaged documentarian, Wildenhahn is also perplexed by this issue and spends considerable time trying to place Bausch in a context outside of the aesthetic. Still, the dance company's daily life and the excruciating rehearsal and performance schedule is solidly captured. The film begins cleverly: a dance critic offers sagacious comments on ballet dancers finishing their careers at mid-thirty just when, according to Bausch, the ""aspects of misery, suffering and fear of death should become an integral part of a dancer's spiritual and psychological make-up."" Wildenhahn's camera glides over the dancers' bodies as Bausch leads them through their paces, a consummate teacher. Leaving behind rehearsals of ""Bandoneón"" and ""Walzer,"" Wildenhahn then ventures out into the streets of Wuppertal searching for the dance of the common people.",de,N/A,0,Klaus Wildenhahn,"NDR, WDR"

Through a wordplay with the religious connotation of the names of the two men, murdered during the worker strikes of the late 1970s in São Paulo, it associates sainthood and Christ himself with the working class. That association is reaffirmed throughout the film, from the very beginning, including by a priest. The martyrdom of metalworkers Nelson Pereira de Jesus and Santo Dias da Silva is the starting point to denounce the working conditions faced by factory workers, and the repression which ensues whenever they try to resist them. However, the film also presents us with the 'official' version of the facts, going so far as to feature interviews with the man who killed Nelson. Obviously, it sides with the workers, as it conveys the strength of the oppressed and the impudence of the oppressors.",pt,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/xwLLgCSDO0VA89TX360dFJNTpkV.jpg,0,Antonio Paulo Ferraz,"Antonio Paulo Ferraz Produções Cinematográficas, Tatu Filmes"

Schroeter alternates scenes from the Panizza’s work with a dramatization of his trial, presenting the play as an expressionist spectacle performed by actors wearing exaggerated makeup who gesture and grimace grotesquely. The film thus forms a bridge between Schroeter’s use of tableaux in his early experiments with the political urgency of his 1980s films.
