The Snowdrop Festival,1984,"35, 18","This movie is based on texts of Bohumil Hrabal, world-known Czech prosaic. It's a story (in a form of a mosaic of short episodes and pictures) about the sadness and happiness of inhabitants of Kersko (Kersko is a small woody area full of cottages and roods). These people are both simple and sensitive, they have their own pleasures (e.g. Leli is a collector of cheap, but inutile things) and the greatest delight of all of them is a hunting. Crude poetics of amateur hunting is screened by dreamy pictures of this area. Menzel mixes sentimental lyricism and rough (but not vulgar!) humor and the outcome is the never-ending landscape of continuous life in the proximate nearness of nature. The performances of actors are brilliant. Both Rudolf Hrusinsky as a Franz and Jaromír Hanzlik as a Leli have nonrecurring charm bottomed on a pain and inebriation. Only the music is not perfect: Jiri Sust usually assembled his film music from his older works and in this movie there is many quotations.",cs,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/4ztIr51xtDWkKOXtjbhiKN9FQc0.jpg,6.5,Jiří Menzel,Filmové studio Barrandov

Angela's War,1984,"10749, 18","In this melodrama about love in wartime, Angela (Ida-Lotta Backman) is a Finnish nurse in Lapland who begins a torrid affair with Thomas Schmidt (Mathieu Carriere), a wounded German army captain. Their love for each other is verboten in Finland, where the Germans occupy northern Lapland until the end of the war. Finland had formed a brief alliance with Germany to fight an invading Russia in the winter of 1939, but when the Russians won that battle and took more than 16,000 square miles of land away from Finland, it was too late to successfully rout the Germans from Finnish soil. So for the entire war, the Finns were fighting Germany on their own national territory -- which makes the love affair between a Finnish nurse and German soldier a very complex issue. While Angela receives different reactions from her friends, acquaintances, and relatives, she continues on with her love for the German, against odds which are greater as time goes by.",en,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/573IhLVZh5aAt2Ry0s5TQKARxoH.jpg,2,Eija-Elina Bergholm,"Jörn Donner Productions, SVT Drama"

Les années de rêves,1984,,"Continuing a saga that began with his previous, 1978 film, Vautours director Jean-Claude Labrecque returns with the French Canadian, Louis Pelletier and puts him in the context of the growing separatist movement in the late 1960s in Quebec. At that time, supporters of an independent Quebec began to consolidate their power under the Parti Québecois -- and the story of Louis and his wife Claudette are meant to illustrate this watershed in Quebec's history. As the film begins, Claudette and Louis are about to get married -- and their wedding day significantly coincides with preparations for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II. Years later, they are well-established in Montreal and are enjoying visits from their family -- and then their lives start to deteriorate. Louis is suddenly out of work, and as he faces the difficulties of finding another job -- and of living precariously -- he becomes more radical, less accepting of the status quo.",fr,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9zhmM8TQEX9nmLM2M5AUOSnWLHW.jpg,0,Jean-Claude Labrecque,

Man Without Memory,1984,,"The norms of hospital practices are turned upside-down in this complex drama about how many rights are denied patients who do not conform. At the beginning of the story, a man is found lying on the side of the road and is brought in to the police station as a probable vagrant, but he has no memory and seems to have lost his powers of speech. Perplexed and defeated by their unsuccessful attempts to make him talk, the police send the man over to the hospital for examination by psychiatrists. After some time, it becomes apparent that he understands everything going on around him and is simply refusing to talk. This sets off a series of antagonistic actions on the part of the hospital staff, suspicious about his ""purpose"" in remaining silent. Although some explanation is discovered as to why he is this way, the supposedly sane doctors and staff come off looking like they may need treatment themselves.",de,N/A,6,Kurt Gloor,

Uno scandalo perbene,1984,18,"Based on a real-life mystery in the newspapers after World War I, this conventional, straightforward story is about a poorly-dressed man who is brought into the police station in Turin for stealing flower pots from the cemetery. He is rather brutally interrogated, and then because he has no idea who he is or where he belongs, he is put into an asylum for the mentally disturbed. After his photograph is published in the newspapers, a woman shows up at the institution claiming that he is Professor Canella, her missing and wealthy husband. The news obtains the release of the amnesiac, but his claim is quickly and hotly contested by another family, arguing that the man is an imposter. As a result, his case goes back to court and in the meantime, the ""professor"" is put in jail. As the courtroom drama continues, there are various clues that suggest whether or not the amnesiac has been accurately identified and by whom.",en,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/4QUF2VprVWjMPZI4mdmyPNhDDIH.jpg,5.9,Pasquale Festa Campanile,

Run Chrissie Run!,1986,"28, 80, 10770, 53","The action moves along quickly, jumping over holes in the script, in this made-for-television drama about Eve, an ex-terrorist from Germany who is forced to escape to Australia with her teenage daughter Chrissie when she is sought by Riley, a lover from 17 years in the past. In turn, the IRA has sent two members after Riley because he shot an IRA soldier and must pay the consequences. The two IRA operatives looking for Riley come across a really nasty biker who wants vengeance on Eve for setting his car on fire -- and the three men finally track her and Chrissie to the wine-growing country of Barossa Valley. The final denouement is about to explode, as Riley also arrives on the scene.

The Annunciation,1984,18,"The Annunciation (in Hungarian: Angyali üdvözlet) is a Hungarian film directed by András Jeles in 1984, based on The Tragedy of Man (1861) by Imre Madách. When Adam (Péter Bocsor) and Eve (Júlia Mérő), having succumbed to Lucifer's temptation, are cast out of the Garden of Eden, Adam holds Lucifer (Eszter Gyalog) to his promise, reminding him that ""You said I would know everything!"". So Lucifer grants Adam a dream of the world to come. And what a bizarre dream: Adam becomes Miltiades in Athens; a knight called Tancred in Byzantium; Kepler in Prague; Danton in revolutionary Paris; and a nameless suitor in Victorian London. Guided by a deceptively sweet but ultimately contemptuous Lucifer, Adam confronts an endless procession of the horror of the human story... rapists and concubines, betrayal and savagery, mindless cruelty and fanaticism.",hu,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5LoaGjyNDP1R2vFYHBYinaXjThb.jpg,5.7,András Jeles,Mafilm

The Wrestler,1984,18,"With good guidance from director Zeki Okten but an uninspired script, this story of a brother and his Turkish family influenced by old and new traditions is somewhat uneven. Bilal (Tarik Akan) is devoted to the art of wrestling, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, who were both champions at the sport. Aside from his interest in wrestling for its own sake, Bilal has a chance to win a provincial wrestling contest and thereby bring home a considerable cash award for his efforts -- and so his days are spent in training for the event. Meanwhile, his brother and sister-in-law and their daughter have come back home after living in Germany for 12 years and are finding the adjustment to their cultural roots a bumpy ride. As long scenes of well-oiled and slippery wrestlers in action prepare viewers for Bilal's big event, the struggle of these men is reminiscent of the struggle of Bilal's family to come to grips with a world they may not be able to accept unconditionally.",tr,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/y6Ha2hhQYbWiFAKzsL3NVhCcfYl.jpg,5.8,Zeki Ökten,
