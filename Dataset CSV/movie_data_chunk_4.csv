The story is certainly fleshed out quite a bit more and the final 15 minutes of the film comprise a surprisingly powerful conclusion (worth the price of admission on its own), but I would have liked a more original story rather then a highly polished version of one that I've already enjoyed. In the end, spectacular visuals, great new music, and well thought out additions to the core story leave you feeling glad to have seen the film.

Música nocturna,2007,,"Argentine helmer Rafael Filipelli's understated and deliberate, slice-of-life drama Night Music (AKA Musica Nocturna, 2007) unfurls over the course of four evenings, with its depiction of an emotionally-strained marriage between husband and wife Federico (Enrique Pineyro) and Cecilia (Silvia Arazi), which Filipelli sets against the backdrop of semi-vacant, nocturnal Buenos Aires. He is a music critic pushing 50 and grappling with the completion of his first book; she is a playwright, in rehearsals for a major new production. Both have hit an emotional lull in their marriage that inspires each to coolly flirt with infidelity. As Federico flirts dangerously with the theatrical director's assistant, Cecilia reconnects at length with a past acquaintance, belletrist Sergio (Horacio Acosta), who may or may not have been amorously involved with Cecilia at one time.",es,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/l2oSvW7ltDSCiSNsobqTYMlepDV.jpg,5,Rafael Filippelli,

Our middle-aged character's life is in a fragile balance at the start and soon that balance will, of course, be disturbed. Even without much in the way of drama at first, an at times nightmarish reality intermingles with nightmares, and, typically for a movie from this region, state bureaucracy and the absurdities of a semi-legal order play a role in moving developments along. So what is it that awaits our hero down the informal road he is officially sent? Complete deconstruction? Or the 'unbearable lightness of being'?
