Cotton Candy,2002,,"Gehr uses a mini-digital recorder to look back on the Machine Age in the form of San Francisco's soon-to-be-shuttered Musee Mecanique.

By treating the Musee's cast of synchronized figures as puppets, the artist is making a show—but is it his or theirs? Gehr's selective take on the arcade renders it all the more spooky. There's a sense in which Cotton Candy is a gloss on the moment in The Rules of the Game when the music-box-collecting viscount unveils his latest and most elaborate acquisition. (It also brings to mind the climax of A.I.: The DV of the future tenderly regards the more human machine of the past.)  (J.

At the same time, scenes from the first part of the movie bring unexpected facts when seen the second or the third time. The stories do not have just one ending: the first story ends in each of the third parts in a different point, suggesting radically different solutions for the characters.

The film shows especially how deeply rooted the sport was back then in the entire lifestyle of the Ruhr area - in private life as well as in society - and how structural change also left clearly visible marks in sports.

"Master, a Building in Copacabana",2002,99,"""Master"" is the name of a 12-story apartment building in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro's neighborhood for nightlife. Over the course of four weeks in 2001, Eduardo Coutinho's film crew rented one of the 276 apartments and used it as home base to make a film about the building's residents. We get to know the building manager, who succeeded in turning the troubled residence into a family complex within just a few years. Using interviews and a few stolen moments in the corridors of the building, Coutinho explores this world. Most of the building's residents come from the lower middle class and are just getting by, but that's just about the only thing they have in common - so many people, so many stories, sometimes told in a self-confident tone, sometimes with averted eyes. The fact that a film crew is interested in their stories puzzles some of them. Hope, fear, dreams, memories, love and loneliness all appear from behind the doors of this average apartment building.",pt,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/n3Nf5XD3PjoQoX0z41bNBwOC8Kx.jpg,8,Eduardo Coutinho,

While they wait, they converse among themselves or with the spouses or relatives who took them to the school. The film proceeds from one discussion to the next as we overhear people discuss both important and trivial matters that affect the lives of women in contemporary Iran. One woman mentions that she is waiting for her husband to pick up their baby from her so she can take the exam; others discuss their hopes and dreams, and there is some tension among some of the boys who are also hanging out there. Eventually it is time to take the exam, so the women leave the courtyard.",fa,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/lx8dj39QL58VzFa967Na4ZOmvT5.jpg,7.5,Nasser Refaie,

MC5: A True Testimonial,2002,"10402, 99","This documentary, made over a period of eight years, tells the remarkable story of an extremely influential rock'n'roll band. Starting from their mid-60's garage band roots (sounding amazingly like the Sonics), the Motor City 5 deveoped into an icon for a brand of loud, crushing music reflecting their industrial roots. Even if you don't care for their music (and you're bound to like even a few of their songs), their story is fascinating. It combines 60's protest, youthful braggadocio, and a style of music that would help carry one to the likes of Iggy and the Stooges (not to mention certain aspects of punk rock). This film is clearly a labor of love, combining extraordinarily rare live shows, still shots, a nearly-continuous backdrop of MC5 tunes, penetrating interviews with the remaining members and their spouses, and even FBI surveillance shots. It's the ultimate testimonial to a band that only gains in stature as time goes on.",en,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/4xGZ5B8eQ9HDthOeFkJFtl7tgSb.jpg,7.5,David C. Thomas,
