Hummadruz,1999,99,"“Hummadruz” is the scientific term for certain mysterious unidentifiable sounds that come from the earth. They say that especially those who have left their homeland constantly hear these sounds. The first part of this film takes place in the arid land east of Turkey. Memories of a childhood romance, children’s games and laughter, sleeping with an ill mother, are sandwiched with close-up images of eyes wide-open, blood, fear, and tension. The second narrative half tells the story of a man and his infant son who for no apparent reason jump to their death off a bridge on the Bosphorus, and a wife who follows. Dramatizing a true story, the film expresses the desperation and frustration of those who had no choice but to migrate to Istanbul from their beloved homeland.",tr,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/2pcykgALJTYOPlHLPdYZTaJu53C.jpg,0,Hasan Karacadağ,Sifa Sin-u-ma Yapım

Are we now embarking on a new level only to learn the same old lessons about humanity again?  In addressing these questions we are taken into the back drop of the history of Germany beginning in the late 1800’s through the late 20th Century at the eve of the 21st.  “A society that does not take archetypes, myths, and symbols seriously will possibly be jumped by them from behind.”",de,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/grIS5eej3LnaWs2H93hN72kx09t.jpg,6,Rüdiger Sünner,Elisabeth Müller Filmproduktion
