Girlfriends,N/A,,"""Girlfriends"" takes a stab at pre-""Sex and the City"" in Chicago, as three 20-something female friends bond together downtown after they lock themselves out of their car. Of all the principal leads, Jacqueline Fleming comes off the strongest.

All three women are attractive- the other two are white women, one is a ditsy lesbian and the other is a sexual bunny who changes outfits a lot.  Directed by the talented Marlies Carruth, ""Girlfriends"" has witty dialogue almost too witty for the women its about- in one scene in a coffee shop, a guy holds the place up, only to be dissected by one of the women as she confabulates to him using preppy vocabulary words.
