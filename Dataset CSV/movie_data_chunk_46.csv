Through the reassembly of these propaganda images, Djebar recovers the history of the Zerda ceremonies, suggesting that the power and mysticism of this tradition were obliterated and erased by the predatory voyeurism of the colonial gaze. This very gaze is thus subverted and a hidden tradition of resistance and struggle is revealed, against any exoticizing and orientalist temptation.",fr,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/qSganVOBZRTxBMylm4ahR1JxVhW.jpg,7.6,Assia Djebar,O.N.C.I.C.
