156 Rivington,2003,,"In the 1980s, 156 Rivington was an abandoned building in New York's depressed Lower East Side (known as Alphabet City or Loisaida to black and Puerto Rican residents).

The film as a whole manages to cover some important topics in the feminist debate about film -- how does one construct a female gaze, how can one film nude bodies without objectifying the actors (of either sex), what constitutes a strong female role -- while also making it clear that “women’s film” comprises as many different approaches to filmmaking as there are female filmmakers.",fr,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/3kMydFxOcWqDUcWW9oSo45OaaaK.jpg,0,Marie Mandy,
