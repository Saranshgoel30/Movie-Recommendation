His work, mostly churches and private homes, displays a unique style that sets it apart from most 20th century architecture. The Episcopal Church in Tulsa built in the 1920s is a towering Art Deco icon, while the Hopewell Baptist Church in Edmond resembles a strange futuristic concrete teepee challenging the landscape. Bruce Goff is the great unknown of an original American form of architecture. Through his photo-driven style, Emigholz brilliantly exposes details of Goff's structures that might otherwise be missed, making these fascinating artifacts even more intriguing.",de,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/yDEvmBU9rNuAquRu5wXO5Sz9v5d.jpg,6,Heinz Emigholz,Filmgalerie 451

Upcoming young directors from local film schools have also profited from Ms. Ebner’s unbroken enthusiasm and passion for film.  However, this eighty-year-old has a more than broken relationship to the events of her childhood and youth in Gdansk – a time when her life was characterised by an anti-Semitic step-mother and the dangers posed by the Nazi regime.
